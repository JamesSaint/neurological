    <h1>Advising ‘Family’ of Medical Situation</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>This isn’t an attempt to reconnect. I’m sharing this because it feels important that you know.</p>
      <p>After years of unexplained symptoms, I’ve now received clinical evidence. An MRI shows a white matter scar on my brain, and there is also a lesion in my spinal cord. The neurologist has raised serious concerns, including post-vaccine injury or early-stage multiple sclerosis. Investigations are ongoing.</p>
      <p>These findings explain what I’ve been living with for years. I was dismissed, ignored, and told it was all in my head. I had to escalate privately to be taken seriously. It wasn’t imagined. It’s real.</p>
      <p>There is no clear prognosis yet, but the neurological damage already confirmed carries serious risk.</p>
      <p>I’m now under the care of both a neurologist and a cardiologist. Further testing is underway to assess the extent and cause of the damage.</p>
      <p>I’m not sharing this for sympathy, support, or a response. I just want the facts known. Because if anything happens to me, I don’t want the story to be silence.</p>
      <p>That’s all.</p>
