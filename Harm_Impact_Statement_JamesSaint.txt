James Patrick Saint â€“ Harm & Impact Statement

Since receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines (Batch PW40008 on 1st April 2021 and PZ46990 on 13th July 2021), I have suffered severe and sustained physical, cognitive, and emotional harm.

The neurological damage has caused:
- Cognitive impairment ("fibro fog", memory and word-finding issues)
- Muscle weakness, coordination loss, and painful neuropathy
- Sensory dysfunction, blurred vision, and joint stiffness
- Ongoing fatigue and reduced physical capacity

This has resulted in:
- Psychological trauma: agoraphobia, PTSD symptoms, emotional dysregulation
- Relational breakdowns and significant isolation
- Financial impact: loss of earnings, inability to work, private healthcare costs
- Mental health deterioration: increased dependency, suicidal ideation at times
- Systemic dismissal and gaslighting from healthcare providers

I live with reduced independence, heightened anxiety, and an ongoing fear of being further dismissed. This experience has eroded trust in the medical system and altered the course of my life profoundly.

This harm was avoidable had early concerns been taken seriously and referred appropriately.
