Harm & Impact Statement – James Patrick Saint

Since receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines — Batch PW40008 on 1 April 2021 and PZ46990 on 13 July 2021 — my life has been irrevocably altered by severe and sustained physical, neurological, and psychological harm. What began as a responsible medical choice rapidly became a personal health crisis.

Neurological and Physical Impact

Within weeks of the vaccinations, I began experiencing a rapid and distressing decline in my neurological function. The damage has manifested in multiple, debilitating ways:
	•	Cognitive impairment – including persistent memory loss, word-finding difficulty, slowed processing, and “fibro fog” that makes everyday tasks challenging and disorienting.
	•	Muscle weakness and coordination loss – affecting my mobility and fine motor skills, leading to falls, instability, and physical vulnerability.
	•	Painful neuropathy – including burning sensations, nerve pain radiating across my skull, neck, arms, and limbs.
	•	Sensory dysfunction – blurred vision, visual distortions, joint stiffness, light sensitivity, and auditory pressure, often accompanied by a sense of neurological overwhelm.
	•	Chronic fatigue and reduced capacity – not simply tiredness, but an exhausting depletion that limits even basic functioning.

Psychological and Emotional Consequences

The physical symptoms are compounded by deep psychological trauma. This has included:
	•	PTSD symptoms and agoraphobia – triggered by the medical gaslighting and isolation I’ve endured.
	•	Severe emotional dysregulation – waves of grief, fear, and rage with little relief or containment.
	•	Suicidal ideation – in moments of despair, where the future felt not just uncertain, but unbearable.
	•	Anxiety and hypervigilance – especially around health settings, loud stimuli, and the ongoing fear of being dismissed or misdiagnosed again.

Relational and Social Breakdown

As my symptoms escalated, my world shrank. Once a deeply engaged father, partner, friend, and contributor, I became isolated. This was not due to personal withdrawal, but from the inaccessibility of support and the invisibility of my condition to others.
	•	Friendships strained or lost as I struggled to keep up with social expectations.
	•	Romantic partnership disrupted as roles reversed under the weight of my illness and trauma.
	•	Family dynamics shifted as I became more dependent and less able to offer the steady, capable presence I was known for.

Financial and Occupational Loss

I have lost my ability to work. As someone who took pride in contributing meaningfully — both intellectually and practically — I now face:
	•	Complete loss of earnings and professional identity.
	•	Dependence on others for financial support at a time when my independence matters most.
	•	Out-of-pocket expenses for private healthcare, supplements, and adaptive care that are not covered by public support.
	•	Financial stress that compounds my emotional and physical vulnerability.

Systemic Negligence and Institutional Harm

Perhaps most devastating has been the way I’ve been treated by the very systems meant to protect and support public health. From the start, I was:
	•	Dismissed, minimised, and gaslit by multiple GPs and NHS providers.
	•	Denied appropriate neurological referrals, despite clear red flags and progressive decline.
	•	Forced to self-advocate in moments of extreme cognitive fatigue and emotional distress.

This systemic failure has eroded my trust in medical institutions. I no longer feel safe seeking help. I brace myself before every appointment, fearing further dismissal, further harm.

Conclusion: A Life Diverted, Not Defined

The harm I’ve experienced was avoidable. Had my early concerns been taken seriously, had medical professionals responded with integrity and care, the progression of damage could have been mitigated — if not prevented.

Instead, I now live with chronic uncertainty, altered identity, and the grief of a life interrupted.

And yet, I write this not from blame — but from truth. Because without acknowledgement of harm, there can be no repair. This statement is my attempt to be seen, to be believed, and to reclaim my voice.
