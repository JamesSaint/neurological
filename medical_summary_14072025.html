<h1>Neurological Injury Summary ‚Äì Prepared for Jo & Legal Review</h1>

<p><strong>Patient:</strong> James Saint<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> July 2025<br />
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This document offers a clear, compassionate, and clinical overview of James‚Äôs neurological condition, for relational clarity, legal insight, and medical support.</p>

<h2>üß† What Has Happened to James?</h2>
<p>James is living with two significant, medically confirmed injuries to his central nervous system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>stroke in the right cerebellum</strong> (the brain‚Äôs balance and coordination center)</li>
  <li>A <strong>lesion in the spinal cord at C5/6</strong>, consistent with inflammation or myelitis</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings were revealed in MRI scans and interpreted by two separate consultant neurologists. The injuries are not subtle. They are visible on imaging and directly explain many of James‚Äôs ongoing symptoms.</p>

<h2>üß¨ How Did This Happen?</h2>
<p>Symptoms began shortly after James received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. He experienced immediate physical symptoms, followed by a progressive deterioration over the next four years. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unrelenting left-sided pain, tightness, and muscle dysfunction</li>
  <li>Visual changes, headaches, balance problems, and fatigue</li>
  <li>Autonomic changes (e.g. hair loss in specific nerve territories)</li>
</ul>

<h2>üßæ What Do the Medical Records Say?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>May 2025:</strong> Consultant identifies signs of high spinal cord lesion, orders full MRI and immunology workup</li>
  <li><strong>July 2025:</strong> MRI confirms right cerebellar infarct and spinal cord lesion. Consultant documents prior myelitis and initiates vascular and CSF testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>üì∏ Medical Imaging</h2>

<h3>1. Cervical Spinal Cord Lesion (C5/6)</h3>
<p>This shows damage to the spinal cord, causing pain, sensory loss, and possible weakness or altered movement.</p>

<h3>2. Right Cerebellar Infarct</h3>
<p>This confirms a small stroke in the balance center of the brain, which explains gait, coordination, and emotional symptoms (as the cerebellum also supports emotional regulation).</p>

<h2>‚öñÔ∏è Why This Matters Legally</h2>
<p>James‚Äôs condition is not psychosomatic. It is not unexplained. It is documented, visible, and consistent across symptoms, clinical notes, and radiological reports. These injuries were missed for years, despite James repeatedly seeking help. Now confirmed, they must be taken seriously for purposes of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medical accommodations</li>
  <li>Financial compensation or vaccine harm redress</li>
  <li>Support with home care, relational understanding, and long-term health planning</li>
</ul>

<h2>üí¨ Personal Note from James</h2>
<p>I have tried to keep going, keep believing, keep showing up ‚Äî even when I was being told it was all in my head. It wasn‚Äôt. The scans now prove what I‚Äôve felt for years. What I need is not pity, but care. Clarity. Support that meets reality. This is that reality. It doesn‚Äôt define me, but it does affect me. And I‚Äôm finally ready to be honest about it.</p>
